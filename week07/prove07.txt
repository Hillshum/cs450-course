When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please provide a link to your classifier in your public GitHub repo.


For each of the following questions, indicate "True" or "False" on the line after the question.

2. Classifier can be built with an arbitrary number of layers and nodes.

3. The number of weights for the first layer is determined by the number of attributes.

4. Biases are present at every layer.

5. Values can be computed at the output layer (by computing the value of every node at every layer)

6. A sigmoid function is used for the activation function of each node.

7. An instance can be classified (albeit not very accurately) with the network.

8. A complete dataset (e.g., iris) can be classified and the overall accuracy reported.
