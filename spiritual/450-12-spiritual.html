            <h1>12 Ponder : Spiritual Learning Challenge - Gain New Insight</h1>

            <p>Your challenge this week is to gain a new insight on the Gospel through scripture study. Study a doctrine or principle, write down questions, prayerfully ponder them.</p>

            <p>If you feel uncomfortable with this challenge for any reason, you are welcome to determine an alternative that follows in the same spirit, but is more appropriate for your individual circumstances.</p>
            <p>If you accept this challenge, please prayerfully consider how you might accomplish it this week, share your progress during class, and finally give a short report of how it went.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Please upload a text file containing a short description of what you did and how it went.</p>
