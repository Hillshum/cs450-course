            <h1>08 Ponder : Spiritual Learning Challenge - Forgive</h1>

            <p>Your challenge this week is to forgive someone. First, read Doc. &amp; Cov. 64:7-10, then prayerfully try to think of someone in your life that you need to forgive, or forgive more deeply than you have before. This forgiveness can be for something small or great. You can tell them you are forgiving them, or perhaps it is something that simply needs to be said in your heart and to your God.</p>

            <p>If you feel uncomfortable with this challenge for any reason, you are welcome to determine an alternative that follows in the same spirit, but is more appropriate for your individual circumstances.</p>
            <p>If you accept this challenge, please prayerfully consider how you might accomplish it this week, share your progress during class, and finally give a short report of how it went.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Please upload a text file containing a short description of what you did and how it went.</p>
