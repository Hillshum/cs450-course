            <h1>09 Ponder : Spiritual Learning Challenge - Deep Prayer</h1>

            <p>Your challenge this week is to find a chance to pray for at least 10 minutes straight. Find your own "sacred grove" where you can be alone and undisturbed. Perhaps its in your bedroom when the roommates aren't around, or maybe in your car, outdoors somewhere, or even in the celestial room. Then <strong>set a timer</strong> (unless you're in the temple...) for at least 10 minutes and don't get up until that time has passed.</p>

            <p>If you feel uncomfortable with this challenge for any reason, you are welcome to determine an alternative that follows in the same spirit, but is more appropriate for your individual circumstances.</p>
            <p>If you accept this challenge, please prayerfully consider how you might accomplish it this week, share your progress during class, and finally give a short report of how it went.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Please upload a text file containing a short description of what you did and how it went.</p>
