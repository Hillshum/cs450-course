            <h1>10 Ponder : Spiritual Learning Challenge - Sacrifice</h1>

            <p>Refer to 3 Nephi 9:15-20. Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: "Real, personal sacrifice never was placing an animal on the altar. Instead, it is a willingness to put the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed!" ("Deny Yourselves of All Ungodliness," Ensign, May 1995, 68).</p>

            <p>Your challenge this week is to find a chance to identify something that you can give up or sacrifice to come to know the Savior better and then commit to do so.</p>

            <p>If you feel uncomfortable with this challenge for any reason, you are welcome to determine an alternative that follows in the same spirit, but is more appropriate for your individual circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>If you accept this challenge, please prayerfully consider how you might accomplish it this week, share your progress during class, and finally give a short report of how it went.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Please upload a text file containing a short description of what you did and how it went.</p>
