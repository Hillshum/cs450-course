            <h1>01 Prepare : Getting Started with Python</h1>

            <p>This semester we will be using Python for our coding exercises. Python is becoming increasingly popular in both industry and academia and is well-suited for data analysis.</p>
            <p>This is not a "coding" course, and at this point in your program it is assumed that you can come up to speed on a new programming language on your own. But here are a few suggestions that may be beneficial.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a> has a straightforward primer that walks you through the basics of the Python language.</li>
                <li>It is recommended to use Python 2.7 (as opposed to the newer 3.4) because it is the version our textbook uses for its examples.</li>
                <li>We will use NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn this semester. You can obtain these separately as needed, or you can get a distribution of Python that comes bundled with these and many more science/engineering libraries, such as: Anaconda (&nbsp;<a href="http://continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> )</li>
                <li>You can use whatever IDE you prefer (or none at all, see: <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/378/</a> ), but one good one you might consider is PyCharm ( <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/</a>&nbsp;). The free community edition is great for our needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Good Programming Practice</h2>
            <p>While it will not be strictly enforced, as in a programming course, you are encouraged to use good style, code conventions, and programming practice.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html" target="_blank">Google Python Style Guide</a> is a good guide to base your code on. (Be aware that the textbook author does not adhere to these principles).</p>
            <p>Finally, as a matter of good practice, be aware that if you put statements directly in your python files, it causes side effects when your code is imported into other files because that code is run. To avoid this, it is recommended that you structure your files with a main method as follows. This will ensure that your main method is run if your file is invoked directly and not if it is included in another module.</p>
            <p>
                <p>import sys</p>
                <p>def main(argv):
                    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; print "Hello World"</p>
                <p>if __name__ == "__main__":
                    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; main(sys.argv)</p>
