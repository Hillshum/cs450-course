            <h1>03 Teach : Team Project - Team Formation</h1>


            <p>This week, you need to form teams for your semester data mining projects. These are teams of three (two if necessary, rather than four). Please refer to the <a href="../teach/450-team-project.html" target="_BLANK">Team Project Requirements</a> for more information about the scope and requirements of the project.
                <a></a>
            </p>
            <p>Then, based on some of the brainstorming ideas you shared in the first week, please use the dicussion board from this week to help self-organize.</p>
            <p>By the end of the week, please submit a plain text document with the following information:</p>
            <p>1. List the members of the proposed team.</p>
            <p>2. Briefly describe your high-level idea for a project.</p>
            <p>Please note that the instructor reserves the right to assign team members / change teams, especially in the case that someone fails to self-identify or there are inconsistencies regarding proposed members.</p>
            <p>Also, note that your project idea can still change after this point, but you should have something in mind to start from.</p>
