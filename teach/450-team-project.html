            <h1>CS 450 Team Project Requirements</h1>

            <p>The semester long team project will provide a chance for you to demonstrate mastery of the principles of machine learning and data mining.</p>
            <p>In teams of three (two if necessary, rather than four), you will select your own data mining project and work on it throughout the semester to discover something interesting.</p>
            <p>The following are the line items of the final project rubric. You should choose a project that is meaningful/challenging enough for you to demonstrate mastery in each of these areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data</li>
                <li>Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>(e.g., data set size, complexity of features, missing data, redundant attributes, obtaining the data, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Demonstrates proper algorithm selection and application</li>
                <li>Discovered something interesting / of value</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>(e.g., about the data, about the algorithms and their limitations in this context, something actionable for a stakeholder, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Demonstrates understanding of limitations of the solution and potential ethical issues</li>
                <li>Conversant in appropriate terminology and technologies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mastery will be observed throughout the semester and specifically demonstrated via a final project report.</p>
