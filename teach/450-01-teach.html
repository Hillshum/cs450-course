            <h1>01 Teach : Team Project First Thoughts</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>A major portion of this semester will be devoted to a team data mining project of your choosing. We will discuss specific requirements in more detail later on, but at this point it is sufficient to say that your task is to obtain a dataset and mine it to discover something interesting.</p>
            <p>To help get this process started, this week, you need to post at least one thought to this brainstorming discussion board.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Post at least one idea to the discussion forum of a dataset, type of data, or an area that you have some interest in. This is not a commitment to work on this project, but rather a chance to share some ideas and explore together. Next week, you will form teams and will ideally have a basic idea of the data or area that you want to pursue. Then we will look into feasibility, etc.</p>
            <p>Remember, there are a lot of us, so keep these very brief and to the point. A sentence or two or a few bullet points should be sufficient.</p>
            <p>You will need to post something by Saturday night to receive credit for this assignment.</p>
