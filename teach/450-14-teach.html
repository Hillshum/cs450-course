            <h1>14 Prove : Team Project - Final Report</h1>


            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Turn in a professional report outlining the process and results of your work on your team project.</p>
            <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
            <p>As discussed at the beginning of the semester, your project will be evaluated according to the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data</li>
                <li><span>Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>(e.g., data set size, complexity of features, missing data, redundant attributes, obtaining the data, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li><span>Demonstrates proper algorithm selection and application</li>
                <li><span>Discovered something interesting / of value</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>(e.g., about the data, a<span>bout the algorithms and their limitations in this context, s<span>omething actionable for a stakeholder, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li><span>Demonstrates understanding of limitations of the solution and potential ethical issues</li>
                <li><span>Conversant in appropriate terminology and technologies</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sections to Include</h3>
            <p>To demonstrate your achievement of these points, please prepare a final project report with the following sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name of each team member</li>
                    <li>The source of the data that you analyzed</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Introduction</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the dataset that you chose, why the problem is interesting, what you hoped to accomplish as you began, and what you actually did accomplish.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Data Preparation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the process of gathering, pre-processing, and otherwise preparing the data for analysis.</li>
                    <li>Include examples of why this dataset was non-trivial and how you overcame these challenges.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Mining / learning from the data</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the process you used to mine the data, or learn patterns from it. What algorithms did you try, why did you try them? What parameters did you use and why?</li>
                    <li>Make sure to discuss different things you tried along the way, even if they resulted in dead ends.</li>
                    <li>Highlight challenges you faced and how you overcame them.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Results</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Present the results that you obtained from the work done in the previous sections.</li>
                    <li>Include graphs and charts to support your findings. (Don't forget to include proper titles, axis labels, etc. for all graphs)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Conclusions (including business takeaways and action items)</li>
