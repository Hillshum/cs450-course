            <h1>11 Prove : Assignment - Ensemble Learning</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Be able to combine different machine learning algorithms in different forms of ensembles.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>This assignment is very open-ended. Your task is choose a few different datasets and apply different classification algorithms to these datasets, both individually and in different kinds of ensembles.</p>
            <p>In particular, the following are the specific baseline requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select 3 different datasets of your choice.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose some that you think will be difficult to learn on, so that you can see the benefits of the ensembles play out. The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html" title="UCI Repository">UCI repository</a> is the source of many of the ones we have used this semester.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>For each dataset:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try at least 3 different "regular" learning algorithms and note the results.</li>
                    <li>Use Bagging and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</li>
                    <li>Use AdaBoost and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</li>
                    <li>Use Stacking and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>When complete, note the experiments and accuracies in the accompanying assessment.</p>
            <p>Please note that Bagging, AdaBoost, and Stacking can all be found in the "meta" category in Weka.</p>
            <p>As always, you are encouraged to go above and beyond by experimenting on several more datasets of different make-ups, as well as significant experimentation with the algorithms and their parameters.</p>
            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When complete, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn assessment.</p>
