            <h1>01 Prove : Assignment - Experiment Shell &amp; Hardcoded Classifier</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Create an experiment shell that can be used to load data, apply a classification algorithm, and report results. As a placeholder, implement a classifier, "HardCodedClassifier", that always predicts the same class.</p>
            <p>More than anything, the purpose of this assignment is to make sure you have the pieces in place to be successful in future assignments. Next week, we will program an actual classifier that will make use of the framework you put in place here.</p>
            
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Write a program that can parse data in from a CSV (comma-separated values) file.</li>
                <li>Please use the popular Iris dataset, found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris" target="_blank">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris</a>&nbsp;. It contains 150 instances of three classes of Irises (50 per class), and four numeric attributes (in addition to the class name).<span>(While not required for this assignment, be aware that next week you will need to handle nominal attributes as well.)
                </li>
                <li>Split the dataset into two sets: a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%). Don't forget to randomize order of the dataset before splitting.</li>
                <li>Create a "HardCoded" classifier that always predicts the first class (e.g., Iris-setosa, but it doesn't really matter which one you choose).</li>
                <li>Use your new classifier to try to predict values for the test set, and report its overall accuracy.</li>
                <li>Create a new public repository at GitHub, and push your code to it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You should code this assignment in Python.</p>
            
<!--             <p>You are encouraged to use Python and become familiar with it, because we will be using it throughout the semester to experiment with existing algorithms, and it will be a valuable tool for you to know. However, you may use whatever programming language you like (e.g. Java, Python, R, C#, C++, etc.) for this and the subsequent programming projects where you implement machine learning algorithms.</p>
 -->
<!--             <p>Also, while not required, you are recommended to use the Weka API (weka.jar) to help you in your programming. For example, there are classes and methods that facilitate reading files from CSV or ARFF formats, and filtering/preprocessing data. For more information about using Weka in your code see:&nbsp;<a href="https://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code" target="_blank">https://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code</a></p> -->
            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When complete, push your code to a public GitHub repository and answer the questions in the attached PDF. Then submit this PDF to I-Learn.</p>
