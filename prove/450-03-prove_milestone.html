            <h1>03 Prove : Milestone - Decision Tree Classifier</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The Decision Tree Assignment can be somewhat challenging. To help you stay on track to completing the assignment, please complete the following portions of the assignment by the day noted in I-Learn.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Make sure you are familiar with <a href="./450-03-prove.html" target="_blank">the instructions for the complete assignment</a>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Create a class for your decision tree classifier.</p></li>
                <li><p>Ensure that you can read in at least one dataset with discrete values and send it to your classifier. It is just fine to pre-process the data in another program or script to prepare it, but you should have at least some data for your algorithm.</p></li>
                <li><p>Have a mechanism for representing your tree, along with branches, leaf nodes, and how it will store attributes and target values.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Have a function that can calculate entropy, and verify that it computes the correct value (check it by hand) for cases with both two classes, and also more than two classes.</p></li>

                <li><p>Have a recursive function to build a tree that can partition the data it receives according to the value of an attribute. And that can call itself.</p></li>

                <li><p>Have the logic in place for at least the base cases of the recursive algorithm.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>Answer the questions in the accompanying I-Learn assessment. It asks you to enumerate which of the above are complete.</p>
