            <h1>06 Prove : Assignment - Neural Network Classifier</h1>


            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, back-propagation for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Add to your experiment shell from previous assignments. Implement a multi-layer perceptron neural network.</p>
            <p>Your assignment this week is to <b>finish</b> the neural network that was started last two weeks, and then to <b>experiment</b> with it on various datasets.</p>
            <h2>Experiment Guidelines</h2>
            <p>After implementing the algorithm, use it to classify the following datasets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Iris</li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes" target="_blank">Diabetes</a>&nbsp;(note this dataset is also included with weka)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For each one, experiment with different parameters for the algorithm.</p>
            <p>Also, for each one, also use an existing implementation of a multi-layer perceptron network and compare/contrast your results (Note: in Weka this is called MultilayerPerceptron under the "functions" category).</p>
            <h3>MINIMUM STANDARD REQUIREMENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the basic MLP algorithm</li>
                <li>Handle nominal and numeric data (if you choose, nominal data can be handled via pre-processing)</li>
                <li>Produce a graph of your learner's accuracy on the validation set (or the training set if necessary) per iteration of the algorithm.</li>
                <li>Basic experimentation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the supplied datasets</li>
                    <li>Try a few different configurations (# of layers, # of nodes per layer)</li>
                    <li>Produce graphs of the training progress</li>
                    <li>Compare overall results to existing implementations of MLP</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>OPPORTUNITIES TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stopping criteria</li>
                <li>Significant experimentation (Seek out additional datasets, compare and contrast many different configurations, experiment with different strategies for starting weights and normalization, etc.)</li>
                <li>Regression</li>
                <li>Different activation functions (e.g., tanh)</li>
                <li>Implement batch and sequential update, and compare results</li>
                <li>Using momentum</li>
                <li>Any other ideas you have</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Questions for Consideration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How should categorical data be handled?</li>
                <li>How many layers should be in your network?</li>
                <li>How many nodes should be in each hidden layer?</li>
                <li>How many nodes should be in the output layer (e.g., one? one per class?)?</li>
                <li>When should learning be stopped?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When complete, push your code to a public GitHub repository. Then submit a PDF with your answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Please submit a link to your GitHub repository for your class.</li>
                <li>Describe your overall approach to implementing the algorithm in code. How are your classes/data structures organized? How do you keep track of the necessary pieces for back-propagation.</li>
                <li>Describe the part of the assignment that gave you the most trouble, and how you overcame it.</li>
                <li>Produce at least one graph to show the training progress for the Iris dataset.</li>
                <li>Compare your results on the Iris dataset to those of an existing implementation.</li>
                <li>Produce at least one graph to show the training progress for the Diabetes dataset.</li>
                <li>Compare your results on the Diabetes dataset to those of an existing implementation.</li>
                <li>Describe any efforts you made to go above and beyond.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Please state which category you feel best describes your assignment and give a 1-2 sentence justification for your choice: A) Some attempt was made, B) Developing, but significantly deficient, C) Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate, D) Meets requirements, E) Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that in order to accommodate the graphs that you will need to have in your write up, this will not be an "I-Learn Quiz" like the other assignments, but rather, you will upload your own PDF document.</p>
