            <h1>10 Prove : Assignment - Social Network Analysis</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Be able to find the central nodes of a social network.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Compute the degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality for each node in two different social networks. Then report the node with the highest value of each.</p>
            <p>You may use any software you like to identify these values.</p>
            <p>The datasets you will be analyzing consist of the network established by Mommy Bloggers linking to one another on their blogs, and mentioning one another in Twitter. In addition, a smaller test dataset is provided for you to start with if that is helpful.</p>
            <p>The datasets can be found here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/1b8e836e-d66b-4f61-91f2-ae49f4d91f51/1/Mommy_blogLinks.csv" target="_blank">Mommy_blogLinks.csv</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/1b8e836e-d66b-4f61-91f2-ae49f4d91f51/1/Mommy_twitterMentions.csv" target="_blank">Mommy_twitterMentions.csv</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A small test version for experimenting if you would like is: <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/1b8e836e-d66b-4f61-91f2-ae49f4d91f51/1/Mommy_blogLinks_tiny.csv" target="_blank">Mommy_blogLinks_tiny.csv</a>.</p>
            <p>These csv files contain a list of directed edges, with the value in the first column representing the source node and the value in the second column representing the destination. For example:</p>
            <p>a,b
                <br />a,c
                <br />b,a</p>
            <p>would represent a graph of three nodes: {a, b, c}, with the following edges: (a-&gt;b), (a-&gt;c), and (b-&gt;a).</p>
            <p>After computing the centrality values, you are encourage to go above and beyond by further analyzing these social networks to find interesting things, coming up with a meaningful visualization of these networks, or analyzing other additional social networks.</p>
