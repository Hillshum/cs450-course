            <h1>08 Prove : Assignment - Apriori Experimenting</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Be able to use Association Rule Mining to discover rules from unlabeled data.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>For this assignment you will not be implementing the Apriori algorithm, but rather, will be using an existing implementation to discover rules in unlabeled data.</p>
            <p>Please refer to your preparation reading for this week. We will be using the same dataset and algorithm that they walk through in their example.</p>
            <p>You can obtain the dataset and algorithm in R by installing and using the "arules" package:</p>
<div class="code">
install.packages('arules');
library(arules);
data(Groceries);
</div>
            <p>Then use the apriori function to generate a set of rules as outlined in the reading.
            </p>
            <h2>Experiment Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Your assignment is to play around with this dataset using different parameters of the Apriori algorithm to identify the following:<br /></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The 5 rules you can find with the highest support</li>
                <li>The 5 rules you can find with the highest confidence</li>
                <li>The 5 rules you can find with the highest lift</li>
                <li>The 5 rules you think are the most <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>interesting</i></span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>For each of these rules, please list the rule along with its support, confidence, and lift, just as you can obtain them from R. For example:</p>
            <p>{other vegetables,
                <br /> butter} =&gt; {whole milk} 0.01148958 0.5736041 2.244885</p>
            <p>After this you are encouraged to go above and beyond these requirements to explore this dataset to a much deeper level, or explore association rules in other datasets.</p>
            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When complete, fill out the <a href="../forms/450-08-prove-form.txt" target="_BLANK">submission form</a> and upload it to I-Learn.</p>
