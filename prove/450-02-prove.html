            <h1>02 Prove : Assignment - <em>k</em>NN Classifier</h1>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Understand a straightforward learning algorithm, the <i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Add to your experiment shell from the previous assignment. Implement a new algorithm, <i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbors, that can be configured for any size of neighborhood, <i>k</i>. To classify an instance, the algorithm should identify its <i>k</i> nearest neighbors and use their labels to determine the target classification.</p>
            <p>In addition, these week you will need to add the ability to read in a data set from a text file that contains both numeric and nominal (think: strings) data. The trick with this is that your NumPy multi-dimensional array only likes numbers, so you'll need to convert the text to numbers appropriately.</p>

            <h2>Experiment Guidelines</h2>
            <p>After implementing the algorithm, use it to classify the following datasets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris" target="_blank">Iris</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation">Car Evaluation</a></li>
                <li>(Optional)<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29" target="_blank">Breast Cancer Wisconsin - Original</a> (There are a few different breast cancer datasets with different properties, so it might be more clear to just work with the other two datasets mentioned).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For each one, experiment with different parameters for the algorithm.</p>
            
            <p>Also, for each one, also use an existing implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and compare/contrast your results.</p>

            <h2>Questions for Consideration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How should categorical data be handled?</li>
                <li>How should missing data be handled?</li>
                <li>How should the labels of the neighbors be used (e.g., simply majority or something else)?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>As always, you are encouraged to go above and beyond and take initiative in your learning. As described in the syllabus, meeting the minimum standard requirements can qualify you for 93%, but going above and beyond is necessary to get 100%. The following are the expectations for a minimum standard, with a few suggestions for going above and beyond.</p>
            <h3>Minimum Standard Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement basic kNN algorithm</li>
                <li>Be able to load datasets from text files</li>
                <li>Handle numeric and nominal data</li>
                <li>Normalize numeric data</li>
                <li>Basic experimentation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play with different values of K</li>
                    <li>Compare to existing implementations</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opportunities to go above and beyond:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>KD-Tree</li>
                <li>Significant Experimentation, for example:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Different distance metrics</li>
                    <li>Several more datasets</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Any other ideas you have</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When complete, push your code to a public GitHub repository and answer the questions in the <a href="../forms/450-02-prove-form.pdf">submission PDF</a>. Please note that <strong>this PDF has two pages</strong>. Then submit this PDF to I-Learn.</p>
